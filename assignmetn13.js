// Q1. QUIET TIMES
// There’s a security camera near Carla’s lab that’s activated by a motion sensor. It is connected to the
// network and starts sending out a video stream when it is active. Because she’d rather not be
// discovered, Carla has set up a system that notices this kind of wireless network traffic and turns on a
// light in her lair whenever there is activity outside, so she knows when to keep quiet.
// She’s also been logging the times at which the camera is tripped for a while and wants to use this
// information to visualize which times, in an average week, tend to be quiet and which tend to be busy.
// The log is stored in files holding one time stamp number (as returned by Date.now()) per line.
// 1695709940692
// 1695701068331
// 1695701189163
// The "camera_logs.txt" file holds a list of logfiles. Write an asynchronous function activityTable(day)
// that for a given day of the week returns an array of 24 numbers, one for each hour of the day, that
// hold the number of camera network traffic observations seen in that hour of the day. Days are
// identified by number using the system used by Date.getDay, where Sunday is 0 and Saturday is 6.
// The activityGraph function, provided by the sandbox, summarizes such a table into a string.
// To read the files, use the textFile function defined earlier—given a filename, it returns a promise that
// resolves to the file’s content. Remember that new Date(timestamp) creates a Date object for that
// time, which has getDay and getHours methods returning the day of the week and the hour of the day.
// Both types of files—the list of logfiles and the logfiles themselves—have each piece of data on its
// own line, separated by newline ("\n") characters.
const { RxValue } = require("react-icons/rx");

async function activityTable(day) {
    // Read the list of log files from "camera_logs.txt"
    let logFileList = await textFile("camera_logs.txt");
    let logFiles = logFileList.trim().split("\n"); // Split by new line to get each log file name
    
    let hourlyCounts = Array(24).fill(0); // Initialize an array of 24 zeros for each hour of the day
  
    // Process each log file listed in "camera_logs.txt"
    for (let logFile of logFiles) {
      let logContent = await textFile(logFile); // Read the content of the log file
      let timestamps = logContent.trim().split("\n"); // Split by new line to get each timestamp
  
      // Process each timestamp in the log file
      for (let timestamp of timestamps) {
        let date = new Date(Number(timestamp)); // Convert the timestamp to a Date object
        if (date.getDay() === day) { // Check if the timestamp corresponds to the specified day
          let hour = date.getHours(); // Get the hour from the Date object
          hourlyCounts[hour]++; // Increment the count for that hour
        }
      }
    }
  
    return hourlyCounts; // Return the array of hourly counts
  }
  
  // Example usage
  async function displayActivityGraph() {
    const table = await activityTable(1); // Wait for activityTable to resolve
    console.log(activityGraph(table)); // Log the result using activityGraph
  }

//   Q3. Building Promise.all
// As we saw, given an array of promises, Promise.all returns a promise that waits for all of the promises
// in the array to finish. It then succeeds, yielding an array of result values. If a promise in the array fails,
// the promise returned by all fails too, passing on the failure reason from the failing promise.
// Implement something like this yourself as a regular function called Promise_all.
// Remember that after a promise has succeeded or failed, it can’t succeed or fail again, and further
// calls to the functions that resolve it are ignored. This can simplify the way you handle a failure of your
// promise.
function Promise_all(promises) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      if (promises.length === 0) {
        resolve([]);
        return;
      }
  
      let results = [];
      let remaining = promises.length;
  
      promises.forEach((promise, index) => {
        // Use Promise.resolve to handle both promises and non-promises
        Promise.resolve(promise).then(value => {
          results[index] = value;
          remaining--;
  
          if (remaining === 0) {
            resolve(results);
          }
        }).catch(reject); // Directly pass reject for error handling
      });
    });
  }
  
// Test code.
Promise_all([]).then(array => {
console.log("This should be []:", array);
});
function soon(val) {
return new Promise(resolve => {
setTimeout(() => resolve(val), Math.random() * 500);
});
}
Promise_all([soon(1), soon(2), soon(3)]).then(array => {
console.log("This should be [1, 2, 3]:", array);
