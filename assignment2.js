// Q1. [1 Point] Explain the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript.


// undefined is what you get when you create a variable but donâ€™t give it a value.
// ex:  let x;
// console.log(x);

// null is used when you want to show that a variable has no value on purpose.
// ex: let obj = { name: "John", age: null };
// console.log(obj.age);
