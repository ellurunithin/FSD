//1. History of JavaScript
// In the early days of the internet, Microsoft offered a free web browser, 
// which attracted users because Netscape's browser was not free. In 1990, Mosaic was a popular browser,
//  but it also wasn't free. The creators of Mosaic later developed Netscape, which was renamed Netscape Navigator.

// JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape to compete with Microsoft.
//  It was first called Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript. 
// Microsoft made a similar version called JScript.

// In 1997, JavaScript became a standard through the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA). 
// Since then, JavaScript has been improved with new features, following ECMAScript standards, 
// and it gets updates every year since 2016. JavaScript is very important for web development, 
// used both on the front end and back end (with Node.js), and it works on both mobile and desktop applications.
