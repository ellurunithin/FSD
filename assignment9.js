// Q1. Explain the .map() function in 
// JavaScript and provide three examples with detailed explanations.
// The .map() function in JavaScript is like a conveyor belt in a factory. 
// Imagine you have a row of objects, and you want to transform each one into something new.
//  You put each object on the conveyor belt, and as it moves along, 
//  a machine (the .map() function) modifies it. 
//  The result is a new row of objects that have been changed in some way.

// Example: Doubling Numbers
// Imagine you have a list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4], and you want to double each number. 
// Using .map(), you get a new list [2, 4, 6, 8]. The original list stays the same; 
// the new list has the doubled values.
